### February 28th, 2024: Individual Brainstorming
Individual Ideas
* (C) Cocktail/Bartender puzzle game / Talk simulator. Serve a few customers during happy hour and talk with them. Each character is suspicious. At the end of your shift, the police interrogate you. Informing you served a drink to a wanted criminal. Remember the conversations you had with each customer in addition to what pieces of evidence the police can share with you and find the criminal.
E.g. Coffee Talk + mystery game

* (L) A farming simulator game about creating a farm and selling items to fund your personal expenses and items you need to buy to support your farm. It is set in a rural area, and there are obstacles like pests and dangerous wildlife that you must protect your farm from. If obstacles destroy too much of your crops, you will not make enough profit and will be forced to shut down your farm.

* (R) Something along the lines of Lil Guardsman or Papers Please, in which the player would have to deal with situations relating to people they rarely met, but they need to decide on whether they help them out to the player's detriment, or if they stick to the rules and deny that person help. Something like VALL-HAll-A where the player must interact with these characters, maybe even growing attached to them, and then having to decide their fate.
* E.g Lil Guardsman, Papers Please, Coffee Talk

### March 6th, 2024: Group Concept Writing & Designing
Hook:  A mystery game about a bartender serving customers, the goal is to solve the mystery of which of the customers you served that night is a wanted criminal

World: A small hole-in-the-wall bar
Emotion/Mood/Tone: Suspense of who the criminal might be, relaxing tasks of creating drinks and talking to customers, muted warm tones to convey a mellow, intimate, and relaxing theme
Goals: Create drinks, talk to customers, find the killer 
Suspense in achieving goals: Plot twist at the end where you realize you have to find the criminal, the goal is to pay attention to the customer dialogue or character description to find the criminal. Use the police’s clues.

Obstacles: creating the wrong drinks, not paying attention to clues 
Interaction: Customers and police officers
Rules: Follow the drink recipe, give the police the correct information, we engage with customers to gain clues
Rewards: Tips or clues that might offer more information, unlock new recipes

What happens in the next level: more customers, complex patterns and dialogue, more complex recipes.

### April 3rd, 2024: Prototype 1
(C) Created visual assets for the first set of characters. The main protagonist who is the bartender and owner of the mixology lounge named Dominic. The first customer is Tiara, who suffered a recent breakup. The second customer is Quinn, and currently in the works of developing assets for the UI and the background of the game.

(R) Formulated and started on the script writing and dialogue of the game. Fine tuned dialogue to make conversation feel more realistic, adding in subtle details and imagery descriptions. Worked to create the initial opening scene of the game, and the opening dialogue.

(L) Crafted and put together the current assets into a UI menu, implemented the dialogue to scroll through on click in the Unity screen, screen recorded the demo of the prototype 1.

#### Preview of Prototype:
##### Script:
Another late night at the small bar. Dominic is reading a newspaper about recent events that have been happening, news of a sudden crime occured earlier in the week, just in the nearby neighorhoods. Disgruntled, he continues his startup at the Mixology Lounge, an area of little room, but lots of attention for the finer things. 

Bell rings
My first customer of the night.

Dominic: Welcome, come on in. Have a seat, anywhere on the bar is fine.

Tiara (Character 1): Good evening.
She bobbed her head as she entered the room. As the door thudded behind her, she jumped slightly at the sound. ( nervous. )

As she stammered across the room, her eyes darted around the decor, gazing at the portraits and artistry tapered across the walls. 

3.Dominic: You look like a new face, what can I get for you tonight? 

Her eyes met the look of the Black Dahlia hung atop the sidewall, enticed by the actresses' complexion. That same longing in both of their gazes.
She dragged the stool from underneath the bar counter and took a seat.

Tiara: …Do you have a menu..?

5. Q Dominic: Actually this is a mixology lounge. Better than your typical 5 bottle bar. Top shelf, bottom shelf, you name it, we probably got it. 
Be confident: Anything you ask for, I can make it easily.
Be considerate: If you want anything made to order, just ask.
Be cocky: Anything you can think of, I’ll make it taste better than anything you’ve tried before.


Tiara: A-Alright, then… how about a Manhattan? A little sweeter, if that’s okay.

Dominic: A Manhattan? Sounds good, leave it to me.

Makes a drink in the game, and can’t fail the tutorial level.

Dominic: And here you are miss, one Manhattan. With an extra cherry on top just for you.

Tiara: Oh, thank you. 
She shifted to one side, lifting the glass and swirling it softly. She stared at the [glass name] so deeply, then took a sip.
. . .
Her face puckered slightly, then eased up. The strain in her gaze started to let up, letting out a little sigh.

Dominic: She seemed like she carried her worries on her shoulder.
So, what’s your case?
You fancying the drink?
How’s the night treating you?

Tiara:
To pass the time really
Oh, it’s a bit strong, but I like the aftertaste.
It’s been a bit, but I’m here now.
  Sorry, I’m Tiara by the way.

Dominic: Well it’s nice to meet you Tiara, I’m Dominic.  

Tiara: I-is it always empty like this..?

Dominic: People come and go, but as for tonight, you are the first. Many don’t even realize that we have a full bar service.

Tiara: Yeah, it’s such a small place. But the music is quite cozy.
That somber look returns to her face.
Looks like a great choice for a date night.

Dominic: Yeah, I’ve had a few customers come here for dates…
Maybe next time you can be one of those customers.
Most of them liked the atmosphere. It’s homey.

Tiara:
That won’t happen anytime soon…, I just went through a bit of a breakup you could say.
She seemed to be happy for a brief moment at the mention of her past lover, but her face contorted into fear.
Yes, the atmosphere is nice, it’s rather calming. Nicer than when I was with him…
She looked away for a brief moment, seemingly bitter about a past lover.

Dominic: Oh I see… I’m sorry to hear that… Did everything end on good terms?

Tiara: Not really, our relationship was always messy. I’m just happy it’s all over.

Dominic: Well, what’s over is over, right?

Tiara: Right…
