Individual Ideas
* (C) Cocktail/Bartender puzzle game / Talk simulator. Serve a few customers during happy hour and talk with them. Each character is suspicious. At the end of your shift, the police interrogate you. Informing you served a drink to a wanted criminal. Remember the conversations you had with each customer in addition to what pieces of evidence the police can share with you and find the criminal.
E.g. Coffee Talk + mystery game

* (L) A farming simulator game about creating a farm and selling items to fund your personal expenses and items you need to buy to support your farm. It is set in a rural area, and there are obstacles like pests and dangerous wildlife that you must protect your farm from. If obstacles destroy too much of your crops, you will not make enough profit and will be forced to shut down your farm.

* (R) Something along the lines of Lil Guardsman or Papers Please, in which the player would have to deal with situations relating to people they rarely met, but they need to decide on whether they help them out to the player's detriment, or if they stick to the rules and deny that person help. Something like VALL-HAll-A where the player must interact with these characters, maybe even growing attached to them, and then having to decide their fate.
* E.g Lil Guardsman, Papers Please, Coffee Talk
